	<h2>What are blogging platforms</h2>

	<p class="qoute">You can safely say that a blogging platform is some CMS (Content Management System) since it enables you to easily manage your content once you have your blog up and running.</p>

	<p>A blogging platform is a type of software or service that you use to create a blog so that you can publish your content online. Creating a blog involves several steps, but the first one is choosing a system that will best fit your needs. Without it, you cannot proceed to the other steps, and you cannot start your blogging adventure.</p>

	<h2>How to choose a blog site</h2 >

	<p class="qoute">One of the best and most popular self-hosted content management systems (CMS) is WordPress.org, also recommended by 90 percent of blogging experts we’ve surveyed.</p>

	<p>The blog setup is called self-hosted because you will use your own web hosting space and name for your blog. For new bloggers, we recommend Bluehost that powers over 2 million websites worldwide. You will get a Free domain name when you signup with them and if you don’t like the service, they offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
